## 🧪 How it Works

1. **Launch App**  
   → Checks for stored token  
   → Navigates to Login or HomePage

   → User taps "Use Biometrics" or "Use PIN"  
   → Calls native biometric or system screen lock

3. **Successful Auth**  
   → Stores token securely  
   → Navigates to HomePage

4. **Home Page**  
   → Shows a welcome lottie
